		<p>I am a self-motivated professional who is constantly thinking outside of the box to improve business needs, processes, and operations. I can attribute my success to creative thinking. I have a strong passion for Marketing and I am always looking for ways to implement that passion in my work.
	 <br>

		<p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family and traveling. I am always looking for different activities to partake with my family. Movie time is one of the highlights of our week for family time. Other activities that I am involved with include Taekwondo and volunteering. I seek opportunities to participate in various volunteer activities at church, work, or activities of interest. </p>
	<br>
		<p>Some fun facts about me would include the fact that I am a big Dallas Cowboys fan!!!! I love sushi, chocolate, and Starbucks. My favorite color is brown, I played the violin for over 8 years, and my favorite TV shows are Power, Rosewood, Star, and Empire.</p>
